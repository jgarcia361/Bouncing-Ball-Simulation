# Bouncing Ball Simulation (Raylib + C++)

This project simulates a bouncing ball inside a resizable window using the Raylib graphics library. It demonstrates a proper game loop with frame-rate independence, FPS capping, and debug information.

## Features

- Ball moves smoothly and bounces off window edges
- Real-time FPS cap switching (keys 1–4 and arrow keys)
- Delta time clamping to maintain simulation stability
- Debug overlay displays FPS, frame time, and elapsed time
- Resizable window with continuous simulation during resizing
- Randomized initial ball velocity

## Controls

| Key      | Action                        |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| 1        | Cap FPS to 30                 |
| 2        | Cap FPS to 60                 |
| 3        | Cap FPS to 144                |
| 4        | Uncap FPS (unlimited)         |
| ↑ / ↓    | Increase or decrease FPS cap  |
| ESC      | Exit the simulation           |

## How to Build and Run

### Prerequisites

- Windows OS
- Visual Studio 2019 or 2022
- Raylib library (included locally in the `Raylib/` folder)

### Build Instructions

1. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio
2. Set the platform to **x64**
3. Build and run the project using **Ctrl + F5**

> Raylib is included locally in the `Raylib/` folder, so no global installation is necessary.
